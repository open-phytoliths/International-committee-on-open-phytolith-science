# International Committee on Open Phytolith Science (ICOPS)

## Welcome!

Find out all about ICOPS and the Open Phytolith Community here. ðŸŒ±

## What is this committee about?

The International Committee on Open Phytolith Science (ICOPS) has been created within the [International Phytolith Society](https://phytoliths.org/) to work on increasing the knowledge of and implementation of open science practices in phytolith research.

We are a global community of researchers from multiple disciplines such as archaeology, palaeoecology, palaeontology and plant sciences.

## What we aim to do

We are striving to make phytolith research more open, reproducible and FAIR!

## Open Phytoliths Community

Open Phytoliths Community has been initiated by the International Committee on Open Phytolith Science (ICOPS).

As a committee we embrace open practices and strive to make everything that we do transparent so that we can build trust within our community. We actively encourage our community to send comments and feedback for any documents, training and initiatives that we make available. We are happy to hear from you and we will include your comments in our work making sure that we give you credit.

We want to explore the different aspects of open science with our community to discuss the benefits and problems with adopting practices such as open data, open methods and open source software. We want to work with our community to overcome barriers and keep reassessing how these practices are best used.

We also aim to be inclusive in the work that we do and this means taking into account the different challenges that face our global research community. One of our focuses is to make our work fully accessible and we know one of the biggest barriers is language. Therefore, we aim to translate our work into different languages to aid understanding and encourage greater participation in our work.

We want to create an active open community of phytolith researchers who can offer training and support to other phytolith researchers and beyond. This is so we can move together towards a research culture that is striving for high quality, open and reproducible research.

We want you to be part of this change, so come join in!
